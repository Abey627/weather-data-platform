# Weather Data Platform - Project Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Configuration
- [x] Update project README with comprehensive description
- [x] Create basic project directory structure (backend and frontend folders)
- [x] Set up initial configuration files
- [x] Set up version control for development

## Phase 2: Backend Development (Django REST Framework)
- [x] Set up Django project with virtual environment
- [x] Configure Django REST Framework
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL database connection
- [x] Create Django app for weather API
- [x] Research and select appropriate third-party weather API
- [x] Implement service to fetch weather data from third-party API
- [x] Develop endpoint for average temperature calculation
- [x] Add request/response models and serializers
- [x] Implement error handling and validation
- [x] Set up Redis for caching recent requests
- [x] Configure Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
- [x] Set up basic unit test framework for API endpoints
- [x] Implement logging and monitoring

## Phase 2.1: Database Integration and Persistence
- [x] Implement data persistence in PostgreSQL (store weather data fetched from API)
- [x] Create endpoint to query historical weather data from database
- [ ] Add database indexing for optimal query performance
- [ ] Implement data pruning/archiving strategy for older records
- [ ] Add database migration tests
- [ ] Create admin interface customizations for weather data management
- [ ] Implement data export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Add data visualization endpoints for historical trends

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (React)
- [ ] Set up React application with create-react-app or Vite
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (Axios, React Router, etc.)
- [ ] Create UI components:
  - [ ] City input form
  - [ ] Days selection input
  - [ ] Results display
  - [ ] Loading indicators
  - [ ] Historical data viewer
  - [ ] Temperature trends charts
- [ ] Implement API service to connect with backend
- [ ] Add state management for application data
- [ ] Implement error handling and user notifications
- [ ] Style the application (CSS/SCSS or styled components)
- [ ] Make the UI responsive for different screen sizes
- [ ] Write integration tests for components

## Phase 4: Docker and Deployment Configuration
- [x] Create Dockerfile for backend service
- [x] Create Dockerfile for frontend service
- [x] Set up Docker Compose for local development
- [x] Configure environment variables for different environments
- [ ] Test the complete Docker setup locally
- [x] Document deployment process

## Phase 4.1: Docker-Only Development Environment
- [x] Create development-specific Dockerfiles
- [x] Set up hot-reloading for development
- [x] Create convenience scripts for common tasks
- [x] Add pgAdmin for database management
- [x] Create production Docker configuration
- [ ] Set up CI/CD workflows for Docker
- [ ] Add database backup and restore procedures

## Phase 5: Monitoring and Observability with ELK Stack
- [ ] Set up ELK Stack for centralized logging and monitoring:
  - [ ] Add Elasticsearch service to Docker Compose
  - [ ] Configure Logstash for log ingestion
  - [ ] Set up Kibana for log visualization
  - [ ] Create custom dashboards for application metrics
- [ ] Integrate Django with ELK Stack:
  - [ ] Update Django logging configuration
  - [ ] Add required Python packages (python-logstash, python-json-logger)
  - [ ] Create custom log formatters for structured logging
  - [ ] Add contextual information to logs (request IDs, user info)
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards:
  - [ ] API endpoint performance dashboard
  - [ ] Error rate monitoring dashboard
  - [ ] Weather query patterns dashboard
  - [ ] Cache hit/miss ratio visualization
  - [ ] Database query performance dashboard
  - [ ] Data storage growth metrics
- [ ] Set up alerting:
  - [ ] Configure alerts for high error rates
  - [ ] Set up notifications for external API failures
  - [ ] Create alerts for slow response times
  - [ ] Monitor database connection pool
- [ ] Documentation:
  - [ ] Document ELK Stack setup and configuration
  - [ ] Create runbook for common monitoring scenarios
  - [ ] Add dashboard screenshots to documentation

## Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization
- [x] Complete API documentation
- [x] Update README with comprehensive setup instructions
- [ ] Add usage examples and screenshots
- [ ] Document known issues and limitations
- [x] Review code for optimization opportunities
- [x] Refactor codebase and remove deprecated code
- [ ] Document database schema and relationships
- [ ] Add database performance tuning guidelines
