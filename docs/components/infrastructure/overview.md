# Infrastructure Overview

This document provides information about the infrastructure setup for the Weather Data Platform project.

## Docker-based Architecture

The Weather Data Platform uses a containerized approach with Docker for both development and production environments:

- **Docker Containers**: Each service runs in its own container for isolation and portability
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates the multi-container application environment
- **Docker Networks**: Provides secure communication between services

## Production Architecture

The production deployment architecture includes:

- **Application Servers**: Running Django backend containers
- **Database Server**: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- **Cache Server**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Web Server**: Nginx for static file serving and reverse proxy
- **Monitoring**: ELK Stack for logging and monitoring (planned)

## Services

### Core Services

1. **Backend API** (Django REST Framework)
   - Handles all API requests and business logic
   - Communicates with external weather APIs
   - Processes and analyzes data

2. **Database** (PostgreSQL)
   - Stores weather data, user data, and application state
   - Configured with proper indexes for optimal query performance

3. **Cache** (Redis)
   - Caches API responses for improved performance
   - Reduces load on external weather APIs

### Supporting Services

4. **pgAdmin**
   - Database administration tool
   - Available in development environment

5. **ELK Stack** (Planned)
   - Elasticsearch for log storage and indexing
   - Logstash for log processing
   - Kibana for log visualization and analysis

## Deployment

For detailed deployment instructions, please refer to the [Deployment Guide](../../guides/deployment.md).

## Monitoring and Logging

For detailed information about the ELK Stack implementation for monitoring and logging, please refer to the [ELK Stack Guide](../../guides/elk-stack.md).
