## Error Responses

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or cannot be served
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server

Error responses have the following format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "A descriptive error message"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

There are currently no rate limits on the API endpoints. However, rate limits are enforced by the third-party weather APIs that this platform relies on.

## Example Usage

### Curl Example

```bash
# Get weather data for New York
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/weather/New%20York/?days=3"

# Get average temperature for San Francisco
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/weather/San%20Francisco/average/?days=7"
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

# Get weather data for London
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/weather/London/?days=5")
weather_data = response.json()
print(f"Average temperature in London: {weather_data['aggregated']['avg_temperature']}Â°C")
```
