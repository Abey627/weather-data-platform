### Admin Interface

#### `/admin/`

Django Admin interface for managing application data.

- Requires admin credentials
- Provides access to all database models and configurations

## Error Responses

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or cannot be served
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server

Error responses have the following format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "A descriptive error message"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

There are currently no rate limits on the API endpoints. However, rate limits are enforced by the third-party weather APIs that this platform relies on.

## Example Usage

### Curl Example

```bash
# Get average temperature for London over 7 days
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/weather/average?city=London&days=7"

# Get historical weather data
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/weather/history"

# Get historical weather data for a specific city
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/weather/history?city=London"
```

### PowerShell Example

```powershell
# Get average temperature for London over 7 days
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/weather/average?city=London&days=7" -Method GET

# Get historical weather data
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/weather/history" -Method GET
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

# Get average temperature for London over 7 days
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/weather/average?city=London&days=7")
weather_data = response.json()
print(f"Average temperature in London: {weather_data['average_temperature']}Â°C")

# Get historical weather data
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/weather/history")
history_data = response.json()
print(f"Number of historical records: {len(history_data)}")
```
