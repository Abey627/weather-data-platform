# Project Plan

This document outlines the detailed project plan for the Weather Data Platform, including phases, tasks, and current progress.

## Latest Status Update (September 12, 2025)

The backend service has been successfully tested and is running properly. All test suites are passing, including the unit tests, API endpoint tests, and contract tests for external dependencies. The service has been verified to be accessible via Docker and responds correctly to API requests. The Swagger documentation is properly configured and accessible.

## Current Focus

Next steps:
1. Continue with the frontend development (Phase 3)
2. Set up the ELK Stack for monitoring (Phase 5)
3. Complete the remaining documentation tasks (Phase 6)
4. Implement performance testing and load testing (Phase 7)
