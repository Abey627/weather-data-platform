# Project Status

This document provides the current status of the Weather Data Platform project. For the complete project plan and development phases, please refer to the [Project Plan](./plan.md) document.

> **Current Project Status:** 60% Complete (as of September 13, 2025)

## Latest Update

The backend service has been successfully tested and is ready for deployment to Render. All production configurations have been completed, including HTTPS settings, static files, and health check endpoints. The render.yaml file has been created and configured properly. We're now working on adding CORS support for frontend integration before the final deployment.
