# Weather Data Platform Overview

The Weather Data Platform is a comprehensive system designed to aggregate, analyze, and visualize historical weather data from various sources. This document provides a high-level overview of the project, its goals, and its key components.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly platform that provides valuable insights into historical weather patterns. The platform aims to help users understand temperature trends and make informed decisions based on historical weather data.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Aggregation**: Collect and consolidate weather data from multiple reputable third-party sources
2. **Data Processing**: Clean, normalize, and analyze the collected data
3. **Insights Generation**: Calculate meaningful metrics and statistics from the weather data
4. **User Interface**: Provide an intuitive interface for users to access the data and insights
5. **API Access**: Enable programmatic access to the data through a well-documented API

## Target Users

- Weather enthusiasts interested in historical weather patterns
- Researchers studying climate trends
- Developers building applications that require historical weather data
- Businesses making decisions based on weather patterns

## System Components

### Backend Services

The backend of the Weather Data Platform is built with Django REST Framework and consists of several key components:

1. **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for data access and manipulation
2. **Integration Layer**: Services that interact with external weather data providers
3. **Data Processing Layer**: Components that transform and analyze the raw weather data
4. **Cache Layer**: Redis-based caching system for improved performance
5. **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage

### Frontend Application

The frontend is a React application that provides a user-friendly interface for:

1. **City Selection**: Search and select cities to analyze
2. **Date Range Selection**: Specify the time period for analysis
3. **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs displaying weather trends
4. **Insights Display**: Key metrics and statistics about the selected data

### Infrastructure

The entire system is containerized using Docker and includes:

1. **Development Environment**: Docker Compose setup for local development
2. **Production Environment**: Production-ready Docker configuration
3. **Monitoring**: ELK Stack for logging and monitoring (planned)
4. **CI/CD**: Continuous integration and deployment pipelines (planned)

## Current Status

The project is approximately 55% complete with the following status:
